# CS607 UML Project 

This project is part of the Requirement Engineering Module CS607

## Project requirement is as follows

Good Food Ltd (GFL) is a catering company which caters for official parties and other events. GFL is a complete event management company, offering clients a full package of venues, accessories and staff for all food and drinks’ based events. The company specialises in organising: events ceremonies, award ceremonies, banquets, celebrations and commemorations. 

The company records information on each member of waiting staff such as: name, staff number, address, telephone number, their availability to work (day and time) and the type of waiting they are trained for (ie. silver service, wine waiting, food waiting etc). Note that many members of staff will be qualified to do several types of waiting, ie. wine waiting and food waiting, or silver service etc. The company also records information on all upcoming events, such as the event type (i.e. party, meeting, banquet, award ceremony), date and time, and client details such as name, address, telephone and e-mail.

The scheduling process assigns staff for each event and stores the entire schedule for all events and personnel. You do not have to describe the scheduling algorithm that is used (as it’s an NP-Complete problem), but your information system must be capable of supporting the use of an automated scheduling algorithm. 
Each member of the catering staff checks their upcoming schedule, using an on-line information system. Each displayed schedule shows only the information relating to that member of staff.
